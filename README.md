# Binary Tree Traversal Visualizer (Menu Driven)

## Project Title
**Binary Tree Traversal Visualizer**

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the fundamental tree traversal techniques used in Binary Search Trees (BSTs).  
The user interacts with a menu-driven console interface to insert nodes, visualize the tree structure in ASCII form, and perform different tree traversal operations.

This project is useful for understanding how data is stored hierarchically and accessed using traversal algorithms.  
It is especially helpful for ADSA practicals, GitHub portfolio display, and viva examinations.

## Features
✅ Insert nodes dynamically into a Binary Search Tree  
✅ Visual representation of tree structure (ASCII sideways tree)  
✅ Supports three primary traversals:
- **Preorder Traversal:** Root → Left → Right
- **Inorder Traversal:** Left → Root → Right
- **Postorder Traversal:** Left → Right → Root  
✅ User-friendly menu-driven interface  
✅ Works directly in VS Code or any C++ compiler

## How It Works
1. Nodes are inserted into a Binary Search Tree (BST)
2. The tree is displayed sideways for easy visualization
3. Traversal outputs show the order in which nodes are visited

## How to Compile & Run
```
g++ binary_tree_menu_visualizer.cpp -o tree
./tree
```

## Example Output (Tree Visualization)

              40
       30
              20
```

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this project, students will understand:
- How memory pointers link data to form tree structures
- Difference between Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals
- How Binary Search Trees maintain sorted structure
- How menu-driven programs improve user interaction

## Suitable For
- ADSA Lab Record Submission
- Internal or External Practical Exams
- GitHub Showcase Project
- Concept Revision for Interviews
